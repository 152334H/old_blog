# Whoami
Python programmer & [pwner](https://ctftime.org/user/75701) with [Sieberrsec](https://irscybersec.tk/).

Future undergrad @ NUS CS.

# [pwnscripts](https://github.com/152334H/pwnscripts)
One fine day, I decided that [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools/) needed better `printf()` automation. I scratched out a [printf offset bruteforcer](https://github.com/152334H/pwnscripts/tree/428d22f36dede9cd442ee38c52bda87988e92a11) and pushed it online, with the full intent of packing it in pwntools as a pull request. [By the time](https://github.com/152334H/pwnscripts/tree/9de122f032324ac17b3ed8667c03b14c5d759b2f) I got my code up to shape, I'd developed a module with [external](https://github.com/niklasb/libc-database/pull/39) [dependencies](https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget) that were, in my opinion, unwise to bundle with pwntools proper.

The end result is what `pwnscripts` is today: a monkey-patched extension to pwntools, optimised for glibc ctf challenges.
